# Executable transpiler file and scripts for building the program on EO

## Directory Hierarchy

These files are located in the `project / bin` directory

## Run scripts

### Launching the program builder on EO

`python3 launcher.py <file-of-c-program>`

The `c2eo` transpiler is launched, then the` collector.py` script is launched. As a result of processing the source file in the C language, the file `global.eo` on EO is generated, which is transferred to the directory` result / eo / c2eo / src / `of the project on EO.

## Support scripts and programs

### Transpilation and formation of intermediate files

`c2eo <file-of-c-program> <name>`

Executable native code launched from the launcher. Carries out transpilation of a C program with the formation of intermediate files containing separately external (global) and static artifacts with the extensions `* .glob` and` * .stat`, respectively. The files are created in the `project / assembly` directory. The transmitted name is generated by the launcher and sets the names for intermediate files. It can also run autonomously.

### Generating the global.eo file

`collector`

Based on intermediate files located in the `project / assembly` directory, it also creates a program file on EO` global.eo`. Launched from the launcher.
