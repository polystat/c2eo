## Transpilation and formation of intermediate files

```bash
$ ./c2eo <file-of-c-program> <name>
```

Executable native code launched from the launcher. Carries out transpilation of a C program with the formation of intermediate files containing separately external (global) and static artifacts with the extensions `* .glob` and` * .stat`, respectively. The files are created in the `project / assembly` directory. The transmitted name is generated by the launcher and sets the names for intermediate files. It can also run autonomously.
